## Requirements

Dockerfile needs a GCF credentials file to authenticate the SDK. 
It expects a file named `gcf-creds.json` placed on the project root.
Refer to the [GCF docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc?hl=pt-br#wlif-key) on how to create this credentials file.
